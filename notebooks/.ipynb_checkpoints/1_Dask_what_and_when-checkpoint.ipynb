    "### What is Dask? \n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python, that follows the syntax of the PyData ecosystem. If you are familiar with Numpy, pandas and scikit-learn then think of Dask as their faster cousin. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd                   import dask.dataframe as dd\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('2015-01-01.csv')    df = dd.read_csv('2015-*-*.csv')\n",
    "df.groupby(df.user_id).value.mean()   df.groupby(df.user_id).value.mean().compute()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " Since they are all family, Dask allows you to scale your existing workflows with a small amount of changes. Dask enables you to accelerate computations and perform those that don't fit in memory. It works in your laptop but it also scales out to large clusters while providing a dashboard with great diagnostic tools. "
